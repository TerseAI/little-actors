# TypeScript API reference

This page documents the public exports of `little-actors`. Requires Node.js 20+ and an ES module project. For a working application, see the [chat tutorial](../../README.md#build-a-chat-room-in-your-terminal).

Deployment management and direct WebSocket connections are documented in the [HTTP reference](http.md). Browser clients use the [external WebSocket connection API](http.md#external-connections).

## Actor

```ts
import { Actor, Persisted } from "little-actors"
```

Base class for actors with saved state. Export a named subclass from your actor entrypoint, normally `src/durable-objects.ts`:

```ts
import { Actor, Persisted } from "little-actors"

export class ChatRoom extends Actor {
    @Persisted history: string[] = []

    async post(message: string): Promise<number> {
        this.history.push(message)
        this.broadcast(message)
        return this.history.length
    }
}
```

Classes must extend `Actor` directly and have no required constructor arguments. The base constructor is protected; a custom constructor must also remain protected for the typed `get()` API. Application code addresses actors with [`get()`](#actorget).

The entrypoint must export at least one actor class under its class name. It may also export constants, utilities, unrelated classes, and types; actor discovery ignores those exports. Actor classes must directly extend `Actor` and use named exports without renaming. A default export is allowed when it is not an actor class.

Remote methods must be `async` prototype methods. Getters, setters, symbol methods, synchronous prototype methods, and the reserved names `then`, `connect`, and `broadcast` are rejected. Class-field arrow functions are not discovered as remote methods.

TypeScript `private` and `protected` do not provide authorization for discovered prototype methods. Access checks belong in application code. JavaScript private methods are not remotely discovered.

### Generics and wire validation

```text
Actor<Metadata = JsonValue, Incoming = JsonValue, Outgoing = Incoming, Tag extends string = string>
```

Declare socket types once on the base class: `class ChatRoom extends Actor<ChatroomMetadata>`. The first parameter types `connect()` metadata, hook sockets, and `this.connections`. The remaining parameters type incoming messages, outgoing messages, and connection tags. Outgoing messages default to the incoming type.

For runtime validation, install `zod@^4` and declare static schemas. Derive types with `z.infer` so schemas and TypeScript share one definition:

```ts
import { Actor, Persisted } from "little-actors"
import type { ActorMessageOf, ActorSocketOf } from "little-actors"
import { z } from "zod"

const metadata = z.object({ userId: z.string() })
const incoming = z.object({ type: z.literal("post"), text: z.string().min(1) })
const outgoing = z.object({ type: z.literal("posted"), text: z.string(), userId: z.string() })
const tag = z.enum(["member", "moderator"])

export class ChatRoom extends Actor<z.infer<typeof metadata>, z.infer<typeof incoming>, z.infer<typeof outgoing>, z.infer<typeof tag>> {
    static schemas = { metadata, incoming, outgoing, tag }
    @Persisted history: string[] = []

    async onMessage(socket: ActorSocketOf<ChatRoom>, message: ActorMessageOf<ChatRoom>): Promise<void> {
        this.history.push(message.text)
        socket.setTags("member")
        this.broadcast({ type: "posted", text: message.text, userId: socket.metadata.userId }, { tags: ["member"] })
    }
}
```

Client code uses the same actor declaration:

```ts
import { ChatRoom } from "./durable-objects.js"

const connection = await ChatRoom.get("lobby").connect({ userId: "alice" })
connection.send({ type: "post", text: "Hello" })
connection.addEventListener("message", ({ data }) => {
    if (data.type === "state") console.log(data.state.history)
    else console.log(data.userId, data.text)
})
```

`ActorSocketOf<ChatRoom>` and `ActorMessageOf<ChatRoom>` reuse the actor's types in hooks. Tags constrain `setTags()`, `socket.tags`, and broadcast filters. References infer client send and receive types, and remote method arguments and results from their signatures. Initial state has the `JsonObject` type.

Each schema is optional. JSON shape and size checks always run. When supplied, `metadata` validates connection initialization, assignment, and restoration; `incoming` validates client sends and actor receipt; `outgoing` validates actor sends, broadcasts, and client receipt; `tag` validates individual tags on assignment, restoration, and broadcast filters. Validation runs before a hook receives input or an SDK operation publishes invalid output. Direct HTTP broadcasts are validated by SDK receivers; application schemas are not installed in the gateway.

Schemas are synchronous validators. Their input and output types must agree with the corresponding generic. Parsed schema output is not substituted: defaults, coercion, transformations, and unknown-key stripping do not rewrite wire data. Use refinements or strict objects to reject unwanted values. Static schemas are not saved actor state.

The message type `"state"` is reserved for automatic initial state delivery. This message uses the runtime's state envelope validation and bypasses the application outgoing schema. Generic types alone do not validate application-specific shapes at runtime.

### Actor.get

```text
static get(actorId: string)
```

Creates a typed reference to an actor of the subclass. Creating a reference is synchronous and makes no remote call. The first operation starts the actor if needed.

**Parameters**

- `actorId` (`string`, required) — Actor ID within the configured namespace and class. See [identity](#identity) for validation.

**Returns:** An inferred [actor reference](#actor-references), exposing the subclass's asynchronous application methods, `connect()`, and `broadcast()`.

**Raises:** An `Error` if the actor definition or ID is invalid.

```ts
import { ChatRoom } from "./durable-objects.js"

const room = ChatRoom.get("lobby")
await room.post("Hello")
```

### Actor.id

```text
protected readonly id: string
```

The current actor ID, available inside an actor method or lifecycle hook. Reading it before the runtime binds the actor, including in its constructor, raises an `Error`. It is not a saved state field.

### Actor.connections

```text
protected readonly connections: readonly ActorSocket<Metadata, Outgoing, Tag>[]
```

Connections available inside any actor method or lifecycle hook. Includes the connecting socket during `onConnect` and excludes the disconnected socket during `onDisconnect`. Access outside an invocation raises an `Error`.

Ordinary method calls fetch the current connections from the gateway before execution. If the lookup fails, the method does not run.

Socket objects belong to the current invocation and are not saved actor state. Each actor supports up to 128 connections per gateway process.

### Actor.broadcast

```text
protected broadcast(message: Outgoing, options?: ActorBroadcastOptions<Tag>): void
```

Sends to currently open connections. By default, this includes the sender when called from `onMessage`.

**Parameters**

- `message` ([ActorSocketMessage](#actorsocketmessage), required) — JSON value matching the actor's outgoing message type.
- `options` ([ActorBroadcastOptions](#actorbroadcastoptions), optional) — Recipient exclusions and tag filters. Omitted options send to all open connections.

**Returns:** `void`. Recipients do not acknowledge delivery, and broadcasting does not add the message to saved state.

**Raises:** An `Error` outside an invocation, for invalid messages or tags, or if socket output exceeds its [limits](#socket-output-limits).

Inside an actor method or hook:

```ts
this.broadcast({ type: "chat", text: "Hello" }, { except: socket })
this.broadcast({ type: "updated" }, { tags: ["editors", "document-1"] })
```

### Actor.onConnect

```text
async onConnect(socket: ActorSocket<Metadata, Outgoing, Tag>): Promise<void>
```

Optional lifecycle hook called when a connection is initialized. The socket is `"connecting"`; acceptance is automatic when the hook succeeds without rejecting it. Calling `socket.reject(4003, "Access denied")` suppresses acceptance and initial state delivery.

**Parameters**

- `socket` ([ActorSocket](#actorsocket)) — Joining connection. Its metadata, outgoing messages, and tags follow the actor generics.

**Returns:** `Promise<void>`. Successful state changes are saved.

After acceptance, the connection receives the actor's saved properties, including changes made by this hook:

```json
{ "type": "state", "state": { "history": [] } }
```

Messages sent with `socket.send()` during the hook precede that state message. Existing connections can receive broadcasts during the hook, but the joining connection is not yet a broadcast recipient. Use `socket.send()` to address it directly.

### Actor.onMessage

```text
async onMessage(socket: ActorSocket<Metadata, Outgoing, Tag>, message: Incoming): Promise<void>
```

Optional lifecycle hook called for incoming application messages. The runtime parses JSON and validates it against the optional incoming schema before calling the hook. Incoming activity wakes a hibernating actor as needed.

**Parameters**

- `socket` ([ActorSocket](#actorsocket)) — Sending connection, in state `"open"`.
- `message` (`Incoming`) — Parsed JSON matching the actor's incoming message type.

**Returns:** `Promise<void>`. Successful state changes are saved.

The [chat tutorial](../../README.md#2-create-the-room) shows a complete implementation that saves and broadcasts each message.

### Actor.onDisconnect

```text
async onDisconnect(socket: ActorSocket<Metadata, Outgoing, Tag>, code: number, reason: string, wasClean: boolean): Promise<void>
```

Optional lifecycle hook called when the server observes a connection closing. The socket is absent from `this.connections` and cannot send messages.

**Parameters**

- `socket` ([ActorSocket](#actorsocket)) — Closed connection, in state `"closed"`.
- `code` (`number`) — Observed WebSocket close code.
- `reason` (`string`) — Close text.
- `wasClean` (`boolean`) — Whether a clean close was observed.

**Returns:** `Promise<void>`. Successful state changes are saved.

An abrupt server failure can prevent the hook from running. Connections can remain open while an actor hibernates, but clients must reconnect after a gateway restart. Connection metadata and tags are not restored as a new connection after a restart.

### Identity

An actor's namespace, class name, and actor ID identify its saved state. Reusing that identity addresses the same actor. Changing the class name or actor ID addresses a different actor.

| Component        | Maximum length |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Namespace ID     | 96 bytes       |
| Actor class name | 48 bytes       |
| Actor ID         | 128 bytes      |
| Method name      | 128 bytes      |

Each component must be nonempty and contain only ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`. Namespace, class name, and actor ID together must fit 243 bytes. Validation can occur when creating a reference or when a request reaches the server.

### Saved state and serialization

Every instance field must declare exactly one of `@Persisted` or `@Ephemeral`, imported from `little-actors`. Actor startup checks the TypeScript declarations, including aliased imports and re-exports. Missing, duplicate, or conflicting annotations fail before the actor module executes.

```ts
import { Actor, Persisted, Ephemeral } from "little-actors"

export class Counter extends Actor {
    @Persisted count = 0
    @Ephemeral private cache = new Map<string, number>()

    async increment(): Promise<number> {
        return ++this.count
    }
}
```

Only `@Persisted` fields are saved after successful invocations and lifecycle events. Restoration constructs a fresh instance and overlays saved values for its declared persisted fields. Missing persisted fields keep their initializer defaults. Unknown saved keys are ignored. Ephemeral fields retain their fresh initial values even if a snapshot contains a key with the same name.

Ephemeral values survive calls while the instance remains resident. Eviction, restart, or reconstruction after a failed call resets them. They can hold caches, connections, and values that cannot be serialized. Static fields are outside actor state. TypeScript `private` and `protected` fields follow their annotation; JavaScript `#private` fields require `@Ephemeral`.

Use standard TypeScript decorators without parentheses. Persistence decorators cannot target methods, accessors, static fields, symbol keys, or `declare` fields. Constructor parameter properties must become decorated class fields. Adding undeclared own properties dynamically fails at construction or when saving state.

Remote method arguments, results, and saved state use JSON serialization:

| Value                                                            | Serialization behavior                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strings, booleans, finite numbers, `null`, arrays, plain objects | Preserved as JSON values.                                                                            |
| `Date`                                                           | Becomes its JSON string representation.                                                              |
| `undefined`, functions, symbols in object properties             | Omitted.                                                                                             |
| `undefined`, functions, symbols in arrays                        | Become `null`.                                                                                       |
| `NaN`, positive or negative infinity                             | Become `null`.                                                                                       |
| `BigInt` or circular references                                  | Fail serialization.                                                                                  |
| `Map`, `Set`, custom classes                                     | Serialize their enumerable properties or `toJSON()` result; prototypes and methods are not retained. |

A method returning `undefined` produces `null` at runtime. TypeScript return annotations do not change JSON behavior. Socket messages and metadata use stricter JSON validation: unsupported values such as `undefined`, `Date`, `BigInt`, non-finite numbers, bytes, and circular references are rejected before sending.

When an actor method throws, its state changes are not saved. External effects, including HTTP requests and already sent WebSocket messages, cannot be rolled back. Socket output can arrive before state is committed; receiving a broadcast does not confirm persistence.

Every accepted connection automatically receives only the actor's persisted properties, including TypeScript private fields. Those fields must not contain secrets that its connected clients are not authorized to read.

Saved state is limited to 16 MiB of JSON. Method requests and responses must fit 32 MiB, including encoded state, arguments or results, and message overhead. Individual limits do not guarantee that a near-limit combination fits in one request.

### Actor validation

The host validates actor definitions at startup. To validate actors without starting the host:

```ts
import { ActorCompiler } from "little-actors/compiler"

const compiler = new ActorCompiler()
compiler.check("src/durable-objects.ts")
```

Actor entrypoints must be TypeScript source files. `compiler.check(entrypoint)` reads `tsconfig.json`, checks TypeScript and actor definitions, and returns persistence schemas. Pass `{ configFile: "path/to/tsconfig.json" }` as the second argument to select another configuration. Compiler tooling is loaded separately from the normal actor API.

Returned field schemas use `Persistence.Persisted` or `Persistence.Ephemeral`. Import the `Persistence` enum from `little-actors/compiler` when inspecting those schemas.

## Actor references

References are inferred from the subclass passed to [`Actor.get()`](#actorget); there is no separately exported `ActorReference` type. They expose asynchronous application methods, `connect()`, and `broadcast()`. Saved fields and lifecycle hooks are not exposed.

### Remote methods

Application methods retain their declared parameter and return types on the reference. Arguments and results follow the [JSON serialization rules](#saved-state-and-serialization). To read a field remotely, expose a method that returns it.

Calls to the same actor execute one at a time, including across `await` within a method. Separate actors have independent state and can execute concurrently. Concurrent requests are serialized, but their launch order does not guarantee their execution order.

**Returns:** A promise for the method's result. Successful calls save state.

**Raises:** [`ActorInvocationError`](#actorinvocationerror) for failed remote operations, or an ordinary `Error` for definition, configuration, validation, or serialization failures.

Actor-to-actor remote calls, connections, and broadcasts are not supported inside actor invocations. Multiple actors can be coordinated from application code. Work that affects an invocation must be awaited; background work is not a durable job mechanism.

### reference.connect

```text
connect(metadata: Metadata): Promise<ActorConnection<Incoming, Outgoing, JsonObject>>
```

Opens a WebSocket connection to the actor. The SDK handles bearer authentication and initialization.

**Parameters**

- `metadata` (required) — JSON connection metadata matching the actor's first generic parameter, even when no lifecycle hooks are defined. Use `{}` for no metadata with an untyped actor.

**Returns:** `Promise<ActorConnection>`, resolving when the WebSocket opens and initialization is sent. The actor's `onConnect` hook and initial state delivery can still be pending.

**Raises:** An `Error` if setup or opening fails. After opening, failures arrive through [connection events](#connection-events); a hook can still reject the connection.

```ts
import { ChatRoom } from "./durable-objects.js"

const socket = await ChatRoom.get("lobby").connect({})
socket.addEventListener("message", ({ data }) => console.log(data))
```

Install message and close listeners immediately after awaiting `connect()`. A reconnect requires a new call with fresh metadata; neither automatic reconnect nor transient-message replay is provided.

### reference.broadcast

```text
broadcast(message: Outgoing): Promise<void>
```

Sends transient output to the actor's currently connected clients. It does not execute an actor method, update saved state, or retain the message for future connections. There are no recipient-filter options.

**Parameters**

- `message` ([ActorSocketMessage](#actorsocketmessage), required) — JSON value matching the actor's outgoing message type.

**Returns:** `Promise<void>`. With no connected clients, there is nothing to deliver.

**Raises:** An `Error` for invalid input or configuration, or an [`ActorInvocationError`](#actorinvocationerror) for a server-reported failure.

```ts
import { ChatRoom } from "./durable-objects.js"

await ChatRoom.get("lobby").broadcast({ type: "notice", text: "Deployment completed" })
```

To save and broadcast together, invoke an actor method that updates a field and calls [`this.broadcast()`](#actorbroadcast).

## ActorSocket

```ts
import type { ActorSocket } from "little-actors"
```

Actor-side connection passed to lifecycle hooks and listed in `this.connections`. `ActorSocket<Metadata, Outgoing, Tag>` describes metadata, sent messages, and tags. Defaults are JSON values for metadata and messages, and `string` for tags. Prefer `ActorSocketOf<YourActor>` to reuse the actor declaration. Import it as a type; it is not a constructor.

### ActorSocket.id

```text
readonly id: string
```

Unique connection ID.

### ActorSocket.metadata

```text
metadata: Metadata
```

JSON metadata supplied at connection time. Assign the whole value to retain a change for later events; mutating a nested property alone does not publish an update. Assignment raises an `Error` if the value is not JSON or fails the metadata schema.

Inside a hook using `ActorSocket<{ userId: string }>`:

```ts
socket.metadata = { ...socket.metadata, userId: "bob" }
```

Metadata is limited to 64 KiB of JSON-encoded UTF-8. SDK clients supply their own metadata; it is not proof of identity or permission. It lasts for the connection unless copied into saved actor fields.

### ActorSocket.tags

```text
readonly tags: readonly Tag[]
```

Current connection tags. Replace them with [`setTags()`](#actorsocketsettags). Tags last for the connection and are not saved actor fields.

### ActorSocket.state

```text
readonly state: ActorSocketState
```

Connection state: `"connecting"` during `onConnect`, `"open"` during message handling, or `"closed"` after closing. See [ActorSocketState](#actorsocketstate-type).

### ActorSocket.send

```text
send(message: Outgoing): void
```

Sends a JSON value to this connection, including during `onConnect`. The SDK validates and encodes it automatically.

**Parameters**

- `message` (`Outgoing`, required) — JSON value matching the actor's outgoing message type.

**Returns:** `void`.

**Raises:** An `Error` if the socket is closed, the message type is invalid, or socket output exceeds its [limits](#socket-output-limits).

Inside an actor method or hook:

```ts
socket.send({ type: "chat", text: "Hello" })
```

### ActorSocket.close

```text
close(code?: number, reason?: string): void
```

Closes the connection. Repeating a valid close on an already closed socket does nothing.

**Parameters**

- `code` (`number`, default `1000`) — Integer `1000` or an application code from `3000` through `4999`.
- `reason` (`string`, default `""`) — Close text, at most 123 UTF-8 bytes.

**Returns:** `void`.

**Raises:** An `Error` for an invalid code or an oversized reason, including when the socket is already closed.

### ActorSocket.reject

```text
reject(code?: number, reason?: string): void
```

Rejects a joining connection during `onConnect` and suppresses the automatic state message.

**Parameters**

- `code` (`number`, default `1008`) — Subject to the same validation as [`close()`](#actorsocketclose).
- `reason` (`string`, default `"connection rejected"`) — Close text, at most 123 UTF-8 bytes.

**Returns:** `void`.

**Raises:** An `Error` unless the socket is `"connecting"`, or if the code or reason is invalid.

The current default code `1008` fails close-code validation. Pass an accepted application code explicitly:

```ts
socket.reject(4003, "Access denied")
```

### ActorSocket.setTags

```text
setTags(...tags: Tag[]): void
```

Replaces connection tags, removing duplicates. Calling with no arguments clears all tags.

**Parameters**

- `tags` (`Tag[]`) — Up to 128 unique tags, each 1–256 JavaScript string code units. Total tag text must fit 8 KiB of UTF-8. Values must pass the optional `schemas.tag` validator.

**Returns:** `void`.

**Raises:** An `Error` for invalid tags or exceeded limits.

```ts
socket.setTags("editors", "document-1")
```

### Socket output limits

JSON text messages are limited to 16 MiB of UTF-8, including JSON encoding overhead. Binary application messages are unsupported. Pending actor socket output is limited to 512 queued operations or 24 MiB of serialized queued output. Exceeding the queue limit fails the operation.

Sending and broadcasting do not acknowledge persistence or recipient delivery. Already sent output cannot be rolled back if the actor later fails.

## ActorConnection

```ts
import type { ActorConnection } from "little-actors"
```

Connection returned by the server SDK's [`reference.connect()`](#referenceconnect). The SDK handles authentication, initialization, JSON encoding and decoding, and declared schema validation. `ActorConnection<Send, Receive, State>` types sent messages, received application messages, and initial state. `connect()` infers send and receive types from the actor and uses `JsonObject` for initial state. Application code handles display and replay beyond the initial saved state. Import it as a type; it is not a constructor.

### ActorConnection.readyState

```text
readonly readyState: number
```

WebSocket state: `0` connecting, `1` open, `2` closing, or `3` closed. The connection is already open when `connect()` resolves.

### ActorConnection.send

```text
send(data: Send): void
```

Sends application data to the actor's `onMessage` hook. Send only while the connection is open.

**Parameters**

- `data` (`Send`, required) — JSON value matching the actor's incoming message type. Pass objects directly; do not call `JSON.stringify()` first.

**Returns:** `void`. This is not an acknowledgment of actor handling or persistence.

**Raises:** An `Error` if data is not JSON, fails the incoming schema, exceeds the message limit, or the WebSocket is still connecting. Later transport failures arrive through connection events.

### ActorConnection.close

```text
close(code?: number, reason?: string): void
```

Starts the WebSocket closing handshake. Repeating a close after the connection has closed does nothing.

**Parameters**

- `code` (`number`, optional) — WebSocket close code. Omitted sends no explicit status code; `1000` requests normal closure. Standard sendable WebSocket codes and application codes `3000`–`4999` are accepted.
- `reason` (`string`, default `""`) — Close text, at most 123 UTF-8 bytes.

**Returns:** `void`.

**Raises:** An `Error` for an invalid close code or oversized reason when starting the handshake.

Client connections do not have the actor-side `reject()` method.

### ActorConnection.addEventListener

```text
addEventListener(type, listener): void
```

Registers an event listener. Event fields are inferred from the event name.

**Parameters**

- `type` (`"open" | "message" | "close" | "error"`, required) — [Connection event](#connection-events) to listen for.
- `listener` (function, required) — Receives the corresponding event object and returns `void`.

**Returns:** `void`. The public interface does not accept listener options.

### ActorConnection.removeEventListener

```text
removeEventListener(type, listener): void
```

Removes an event listener.

**Parameters**

- `type` (`"open" | "message" | "close" | "error"`, required) — Event name used when registering.
- `listener` (function, required) — The same function passed to `addEventListener()`.

**Returns:** `void`.

### Connection events

| Event     | Fields                                                                 | Meaning                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`    | `type: "open"`                                                         | Connection opened. Normally occurs before `connect()` returns the connection. |
| `message` | `type: "message"`, `data: Receive \| ActorStateMessage<State>`         | Initial state or actor-sent application data.                                 |
| `close`   | `type: "close"`, `code: number`, `reason: string`, `wasClean: boolean` | Connection closed.                                                            |
| `error`   | `type: "error"`                                                        | Connection error. The public event type has no message field.                 |

The initial state arrives as a parsed object with shape `{"type":"state","state":{...}}`. Its state contains the actor's persisted fields and has the `JsonObject` type; narrow field values before using them. Application messages are parsed and checked against the outgoing schema. Malformed JSON or invalid messages cause an `error` event and closure with code `1007`; binary frames close with `1003`. See [close behavior](http.md#close-behavior) for common server codes.

## ActorInvocationError

```ts
import { ActorInvocationError } from "little-actors"
```

An `Error` subclass for failed remote operations. Its `name` is `"ActorInvocationError"`.

```text
new ActorInvocationError(code: string, requestId: string, message: string)
```

**Parameters**

- `code` (`string`, required) — Error category.
- `requestId` (`string`, required) — ID of the caller attempt.
- `message` (`string`, required) — Failure description, available through the inherited `message` property.

```ts
import { ActorInvocationError } from "little-actors"

import { ChatRoom } from "./durable-objects.js"

try {
    await ChatRoom.get("lobby").post("Hello")
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ActorInvocationError) {
        console.error(error.code, error.requestId, error.message)
    }
    throw error

### ActorInvocationError.code

```text
readonly code: string
```

Server-reported error category. This is an open string, not a closed enum; additional codes can occur.

| Code                 | Meaning                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unauthenticated`    | Session token rejected or access not permitted. HTTP `401` and `403` during method calls map to this code. |
| `actor_error`        | Actor execution failed, including user exceptions or invalid output.                                       |
| `resource_exhausted` | Execution resource limit reached.                                                                          |
| `socket_gateway_unavailable` | The host could not load connections from the gateway. The actor method did not run. |
| `unavailable`        | Actor could not be reached or made available.                                                              |
| `outcome_unknown`    | Caller could not confirm the result; the operation may have run and saved state.                           |
| `invalid_request`    | Invalid request reported by the server.                                                                    |
| `conflict`           | Deployment conflict reported by the server.                                                                |
| `internal`           | Server failure.                                                                                            |

### ActorInvocationError.requestId

```text
readonly requestId: string
```

Identifies the caller attempt. It is not an application idempotency key.

### Errors and retries

The SDK can recover from a changed actor location, but application operations are not automatically idempotent. Retrying an uncertain outcome can run an operation twice. An application can store a caller-supplied operation ID and its result in actor state to recognize duplicates.

Validation, actor definition, configuration, serialization, and socket failures can be ordinary `Error` instances. `ActorInvocationError` is the only application error class exported from the package root. Other errors need not have `code` or `requestId`.

## Types

These types are exported from `little-actors` alongside `ActorSocket` and `ActorConnection`.

### ActorSocketOf and ActorMessageOf

`ActorSocketOf<Instance>` derives an actor-side socket's metadata, outgoing message, and tag types. `ActorMessageOf<Instance>` derives the incoming message type. Pass the actor instance type, such as `ChatRoom`, rather than `typeof ChatRoom`.

### ActorSchemas

`ActorSchemas<Metadata, Incoming, Outgoing = Incoming, Tag extends string = string>` describes optional Zod validators named `metadata`, `incoming`, `outgoing`, and `tag`. See [generics and wire validation](#generics-and-wire-validation).

### ActorStateMessage

```text
interface ActorStateMessage<State> {
    readonly type: "state"
    readonly state: State
}
```

The automatic initial state message, included in the client message event union. Narrow on `data.type === "state"` when using an application message union with distinct `type` values.

### ActorClass

```ts
import type { ActorClass } from "little-actors"
```

```text
type ActorClass<Instance extends Actor<unknown, unknown, unknown> = Actor<unknown, unknown, unknown>> = Function & {
    readonly prototype: Instance
    readonly schemas?: ActorSchemas
}
```

An actor class whose prototype has type `Instance`. The type describes the class object; runtime discovery still enforces the [actor definition rules](#actor).

### ActorBroadcastOptions

```ts
import type { ActorBroadcastOptions } from "little-actors"
```

`ActorBroadcastOptions<Tag = string>` supplies recipient filters for [`Actor.broadcast()`](#actorbroadcast). Both properties are readonly and optional; filters and exclusions can be combined.

#### ActorBroadcastOptions.except

```text
readonly except?: Pick<ActorSocket, "id"> | readonly Pick<ActorSocket, "id">[]
```

Connections to exclude. Defaults to none; at most 128 exclusions are allowed.

#### ActorBroadcastOptions.tags

```text
readonly tags?: readonly Tag[]
```

Deliver only to connections having **all** listed tags. Omitted or empty means no tag filter. Each tag must contain 1–256 JavaScript string code units and pass the actor's tag schema. The same count and byte limits as `setTags()` apply.

### ActorSocketMessage

```text
type ActorSocketMessage = string | number | boolean | null
    | readonly ActorSocketMessage[]
    | { readonly [key: string]: ActorSocketMessage }
```

The default JSON message type. Strings are encoded as JSON strings; raw text and binary frames are unsupported by the SDK. Import with `import type { ActorSocketMessage } from "little-actors"`.

### ActorSocketState (type)

```text
type ActorSocketState = "connecting" | "open" | "closed"
```

Actor-side connection state. Import with `import type { ActorSocketState } from "little-actors"`. Client connections instead expose numeric [`readyState`](#actorconnectionreadystate).

## Client configuration

Set environment variables before the first remote operation. Configuration is loaded lazily and cached; changing the environment afterward does not reconfigure the existing client. The package root exposes no per-client configuration constructor.

```sh
export DURABLE_OBJECT_API_KEY='<your-api-key>'
export DURABLE_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL='https://objects.example.com'
```

Local [`run`](cli.md#run-a-client) supplies these values automatically. Keep the API key in trusted backend processes. Mobile and browser clients use the [external WebSocket API](http.md#external-connections).

### DURABLE_OBJECT_API_KEY

**Required for backend access.** The server's API key authorizes deployment management and application operations. The SDK obtains and renews short-lived actor invocation tickets automatically.

### DURABLE_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL

**Required.** HTTP(S) server origin. A port and trailing slash are allowed; paths, queries, fragments, usernames, and passwords are not.

### DURABLE_OBJECT_SOCKET_GATEWAY_URL

**Default:** `DURABLE_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`.

Separate HTTP(S) WebSocket gateway origin, with the same origin restrictions. Use `https://sockets.example.com`; the SDK chooses the corresponding WebSocket scheme.

### Advanced credentials and scope

`DURABLE_OBJECT_TOKEN` can replace the API key for delegated execution. Configure exactly one of the two credentials. The SDK does not renew delegated session tokens.

`DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE_ID` is optional. Without it, the server selects the default application for API-key callers or derives the namespace from a session token. An explicit value must satisfy the [identity rules](#identity) and match the session token's scope when using one.

See [advanced access configuration](../guides/advanced-access.md) for examples and migration of existing namespaces.
